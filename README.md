# Antibody Docking and Affinity Benchmark
This repository contains test cases, with unbound and bound structures in PDB format, for an antibody-antigen docking and affinity benchmark. Users can download this set to test and benchmark their predictive algorithms. This set contains 67 nonredundant antibody-antigen complexes paired with unbound structures, over doubling the amount of unbound cases present in Docking Benchmark 5.0, which was released in 2015 (Vreven et al. "Updates to the Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction Benchmarks: Docking Benchmark Version 5 and Affinity Benchmark Version 2" J Mol Biol 427(19):3031-41).
